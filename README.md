# Roam
<i><b>Do cool internet things without using any data</b></i>

Roam allows users to get directions, request a ride from Uber, and even see what the weather will be like without using data!<br>
Using Twilio, Roam sends and receives requested data through SMS messages sent to the user's phone. This data is then interpreted by our app and displayed back to the user in a meaningful way, all through our interface.
